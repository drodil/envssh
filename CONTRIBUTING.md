# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute with PRs as well as issues. If you have a good
idea for a feature or you find a bug, feel free to create an issue.

## Reporting a bug

Use Issues to file bugs. Please follow these guidelines:

* Search existing issues first, make sure yours hasn't already been reported
* Stay on topic, but describe the issue in detail so that others can reproduce
  it
* **Provide a screenshot or parameters used** if possible

## Feature requests

Please check that your request has not already been posted in the Issues. If it
has, up-voting increases the changes it'll be noticed and implemented in the
future.

## Pull requests

When creating pull requests, please test your code and existing features. While
we do not have automatic tests in place at the moment, it's crucial not to break
existing functionality.
